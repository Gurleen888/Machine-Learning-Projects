## Project Overview
• Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches<br/>
• Engineered features .... <br/>
• Optimized Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model

## Resources Used
• Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn<br/>
• Dataset by **Shivam Mitra**: https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor

## Data Cleaning

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Feature Engineering
• Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables <br/>
• Split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%

## Model Building
Algorithms used for this project are as follows:<br/>
• Multiple Linear Regression <br/>
• Decision Tree <br/>
• Random Forest <br/>
• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)

## Model Evaluation
I have used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, and here are the scores:<br/>
• Multiple Linear Regression - <br/>
• Decision Tree - <br/>
• Random Forest - <br/>
• Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) - 

## Future Scope
• Add columns in dataset of top batsmen and bowlers of all the teams.<br/>
• Add columns that consists of striker and non-striker's strike rates.<br/>
• Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).<br/>
